# Plot_GWAS
Simple ggplot2 code to plot GWAS results, researchers need a genotypic map file and file with GWAS results containing SNPs and P values. Alternatively, the code can be modified 
to plot additive effects from GWAS/Genomic Selection models and remove the code that plots a P value cut off.
